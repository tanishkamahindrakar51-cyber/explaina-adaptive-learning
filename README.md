# Explaina — Smarts Start Here

## Overview

Explaina is an adaptive learning platform designed to address the limitations of standardized education systems. 
Traditional learning models often encourage short-term memorization rather than conceptual understanding.

Explaina aims to personalize learning by adjusting explanations and content recommendations based on individual comprehension levels.

## Problem Statement

Students frequently rely on last-minute exam preparation, leading to low retention and shallow understanding. 
Additionally, existing educational video resources are standardized and do not account for differences in grasping ability.

## Research Basis

A survey on student learning habits indicated:

- Strong preference for videos and animations over textbook reading.
- Lack of personalized explanation depth.
- Difficulty finding content aligned with individual understanding speed.

These findings motivated the development of an adaptive solution.

## System Workflow

1. The user completes a structured assessment to evaluate comprehension and focus level.
2. The user submits a subject-specific doubt.
3. The system generates:
   - A theoretical explanation calibrated to the user’s comprehension level.
   - A contextually relevant video aligned with that level.

## MVP Implementation

The MVP is developed using an AI-powered web development platform (Base44).

Core capabilities:
- Comprehension-level assessment module
- Doubt submission interface
- AI-generated adaptive explanations
- Relevant video recommendation system

## Future Scope

- Fully dynamic animated video generation
- Learning progress analytics
- Multi-subject scalability
- Long-term retention tracking

## Vision

To transition education from memorization-based learning to adaptive, comprehension-driven understanding.
