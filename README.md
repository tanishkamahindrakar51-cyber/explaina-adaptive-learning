# Explaina — Smarts Start Here

## 📌 Problem Statement
The current education system encourages short-term memorization instead of deep understanding. 
Students often study one night before exams, write answers, and forget the concepts afterward. 
There is a lack of personalized learning resources that adapt to different levels of comprehension.

## 📊 Research Insight
I conducted a survey on student learning habits and found:
- Students prefer videos and animations over traditional textbook reading.
- Available educational videos are standardized.
- There is little personalization based on individual grasping ability.

This research motivated the creation of Explaina.

## 💡 Solution
Explaina is an adaptive learning platform that:
1. Assesses a student’s comprehension and focus level through a structured test.
2. Allows students to ask subject-specific doubts.
3. Provides:
   - A personalized theoretical explanation.
   - A relevant YouTube video suited to the student’s understanding level.

The goal is to move from standardized education to adaptive education.
